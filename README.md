# YouTube Transcriber/ Summarizer
YouTube Transcriber is a Python script that automatically transcribes YouTube videos.
This script uses the OpenAI API to generate a transcript for any public YouTube video.

You will further get the summarised version of the transcription.

## Advantages
- Saves time: You don't have to watch the entire content of the video.
- Accessibility: The transcripts can help make videos more accessible to those with hearing disabilities or language barriers.
- Easy to use: Just provide a valid YouTube video URL, and the script will do the rest.

## Usage
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install the required packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
- Obtain a OpenAI API key and add it as an environment variable named OPENAI_API_KEY.
- Run the script by providing a valid YouTube video URL as an argument. For example: python youtube_transcriber.py https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ.

## Notes
- The script only works with public YouTube videos.
- The transcription may not be 100% accurate, but it should give a good approximation of the video's content.
